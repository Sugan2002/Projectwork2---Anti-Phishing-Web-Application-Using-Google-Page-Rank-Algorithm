## Anti-Phishing Web Application Using Google Page Rank Algorithm
This project focuses on developing a robust anti-phishing system using machine learning techniques. By leveraging features extracted from URLs and employing machine learning models, it aims to accurately classify URLs as either legitimate or phishing. The system's effectiveness is validated through model training, evaluation, and deployment via a Flask web application.

## About
This project revolves around the development of an advanced anti-phishing system using machine learning methodologies. Phishing, a prevalent cyber threat, involves deceptive techniques aimed at acquiring sensitive information from users. Traditional methods for identifying phishing attempts often fall short due to the evolving nature of cyber threats. Therefore, this project proposes an innovative solution that harnesses the power of machine learning algorithms to detect and thwart phishing attempts effectively.

The system employs a multifaceted approach to phishing detection. It begins by extracting relevant features from URLs, encompassing various aspects such as URL length, presence of IP address, domain age, and redirection count. These features are then utilized as input for machine learning models trained on labeled datasets containing examples of both legitimate and phishing URLs. Leveraging supervised learning techniques, the models learn to discern patterns indicative of phishing behavior, thereby enabling accurate classification of URLs.

To ensure the system's robustness and efficacy, rigorous evaluation is conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the system's performance is assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, providing insights into its ability to balance true positive and false positive rates.

Furthermore, the project encompasses the development of a user-friendly web interface using Flask, allowing users to input URLs and receive instant feedback on their legitimacy. This interface serves as a practical implementation of the anti-phishing system, providing a seamless experience for users seeking protection against cyber threats.

Overall, this project represents a comprehensive endeavor to combat phishing attacks through the integration of machine learning, data analysis, and web development techniques, contributing to the enhancement of cybersecurity in the digital landscape.
